# sahithsWebsite
A personal website project I worked on which contains some information about me. Written in HTML5/CSS. Although the basic workings are in place, I am still 
going to be adding new things to it such as a Blog and mini-programs that I work on in my spare time. As of now (7/31/22), the navigation buttons at the top
do not lead anywhere. However, once I add functionality to them, this will be a multipage website!
